Paste your code to the BinaryHeap.cpp and MeshGraph.cpp files inside "your_code" directory. Unzip answers.zip and objects.zip. Then run ```python3 tester.py```

**This is a Unix port of the existent pa3 tester**

I did slight changes to it to make it work on Unix systems.
I also updated answer46.txt and answer107.txt cases.
